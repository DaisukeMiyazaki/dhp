# Dream House Project

This is a repository for site: DreamHouseProject.
Currenly live on https://mdaisuke.net/dhp

# Tech Stack

This repository is designed to use out of the box with scripts for data preparation, static site generation as well as deployment to your site.

1. You place your photos you want to share with the world under /images/original
2. run convert_image_to_thumbnails_and_generate_site.sh
3. thumbnails as well as this site is generated.

# Advantage of this site

1. No server needs to run nor deployed to cloud, which can cut the cost of cloud and compute. (At the end of the day, no need to run a server if there's no request coming)
2. Custom javascript can run on the client site to do necessary frontend stuff.
3. With github page you can host this under your account name for free.

# What Not To Do In This Repository

I'd like to keep this repository as minimun as possible to a static HTML page for the site. No server deployment is aimed because that introduces another complex layer, such as preparing a hardware machine like EC2, installing OS and a server etc.

# Contibution

Any contibution such as issues, Pull requests are all welcome!
